#  State : Redux Store


## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

```

The following animation shows how the user can select a category, choose a product, view details about it on the product page, and add and remove it from their shopping cart:

## Getting Started

For instructions to add Redux to your application, refer to the [Redux Fundamentals basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial). Note that the documentation will refer to additional packages that you'll need to complete this implementation.

Be sure to review ALL of the documentation, because there are newer methods that can make these tools much easier to implement. React has gone through several iterations; as such, some React-and-Redux tutorials will assume that you aren't using Hooks.

**Important**: The homework requires a specific version `(>=7.0)` of `npm` in order to install peer dependencies like GraphQL when deploying to Heroku. By default, Heroku uses `npm 6.x`, which may cause some issues. Be sure to refer to the [Heroku Docs on Specifying an NPM Version](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#specifying-an-npm-version) to ensure your `package.json` file is set up correctly, as shown in the following snippet:

  ```json
  {
    "engines": {
      "npm": "7.x"
    }
  }
  ```
